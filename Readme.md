SEA8 - Quest: Java 08: Interface

Challenge: I Believe I Can Fly!

In order to practice creating and implementing an interface, first do a Fork of the following repository then clone it locally.

Don't forget to Fork, otherwise you won't be able to push anything! Don't know how to Fork a repository ? Look at this GitHub documentation.

Go through the repo and take a look at its content:
Bird, an abstract class

Eagle, a class inherited from Bird   

Swim, an interface    

Penguin, a class inherited from Bird which implements Swim   

Nature, which you will compile and run to see how everything works

Create a Fly interface.

Add the following methods to the Fly interface:

takeOff with no arguments, and returns nothing    

ascend which takes an integer meters as an argument, and returns an integer    

descend which takes an integer meters as an argument, and returns an integer    

land with no arguments, which returns nothing    

glide, with no arguments, which returns nothing and has a default behaviour: displaying the text "glides into the air."

Make it so that the Fly interface is implemented by the Eagle class.
You will be able to determine the behaviour of the methods, but each method must display text in the console.    

If you need a little inspiration, feel free to check out the implementation of Swim in Penguin.

Undo the commenting out of the Eagle methods being called in Nature.

Compile and test Nature. Once everything works, create a git repository and save it all to GitHub.

Share the link of your GitHub repository as your solution.
